# QPSKModulator
DSP Project class (University of applied sciences Karlsruhe) on the topic 'QPSK Modulator'

This project was aimed at getting to know the TMS320C6713 DSP from texas Instruments better and implementing a simple QPSK modulator together with fellow students from Romania.

May it help future students to master the C6713 SDK or provide some code examples for other projects. 

Please beware that some of my git commit messages probably made it to http://www.commitlogsfromlastnight.com/ .. But to be honest: Haven't we all been there at least once? :)
